            <h3>Pac-Man AI</h3>
            <p>Using Python and the libary PyGame, I recreated the game of Pac-Man. After I had the game created and functional, I hooked up the controls of Pac-Man to a neural network that used the NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies (NEAT) algorithm.
            </p>
            <p>This was a great learning experience that required both pathfinding algorithms for the ghosts' movement and machine learning concepts and methodologies to implement the neural network.</p>

            <h3>Flappy Bird in JavaScript</h3>
            <p>Using vanilla JavaScript and a little bit of HTML, I recreated the game of Flappy Bird. The game keeps track of your current score as well as high score for your current session.</p>
            <p>This was a fun project that gave me some good exposure to JavaScript and its potential for interactivity in other applications.</p>

            <h3>Music Store/Database</h3>
            <p>In this project, I created a website that allowed users to browse and "purchase" music using a database found online of a music store (songs, employees, customers. and others). There was also an employee login so that they could see the customers
                they have sold to and metrics pertaining to their performance.</p>
            <p>I learned a lot about interacting with a database via SQL in this project as well as how a database should be structured.</p>

            <p>Intern</p>
            <p>Jan. 2019 - Current</p>
            <p>Currently, I am interning within Kellogg's Category Management organization. Our main objective is to increase our products' performance with data-driven in-store placement.</p>
            <p>How I contribute to our objective is by retreiving and harmoninzing disparate data from vendors such as Nielsen and IRI, as well as our internal shipment data. I do most of the data retreival through SQL queries and harmonize using Python.</p>
            <p>After gathering all of the data, I begin building out interactive and exploratory reports within Tableau--a data-visualization software--that will allow our people in the field, as well as upper-management, gain insights into the marketplace.</p>

            <p>Oct. 2016 - Dec. 2018</p>
            <p>This is where my professional career really began (after some odd-jobs and retail). This role was very interesting and was a global operation, so I even learned some geography along the way.</p>
            <p>My manager and I were tasked with ensuring that all of our customers were adhering to our purchasing agreement and making sure that nothing would be done to potentially harm our brand equity.</p>
            <p>That's about as much as I can give, but nonetheless very interesting start to my career.</p>
